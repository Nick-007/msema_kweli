- **Development Agenda Validation**: Fact-check whether specific development projects align with county priorities and approved budgets.
- **Budget Analysis**: Access the County's budget estimates for detailed expenditure and development project funding.
- **Expenditure Insights**: Identify discrepancies in spending, such as unsupported payments or misclassified expenditures, based on data from official audit reports.
